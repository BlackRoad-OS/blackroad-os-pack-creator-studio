# Rights and Attribution Notes

- Track the source of every asset (transcripts, images, music) and keep links to licenses or contributor handles.
- Prefer public-domain or explicitly licensed resources; store the license reference next to the asset metadata.
- Attribute collaborators and editors when publishing clips or longform derivatives.
- Avoid making legal commitments in generated copy; route anything sensitive to a human reviewer.
- Include disclaimers when claims relate to regulated topics (health, finance) and avoid overpromising outcomes.
